This project is a data viewer for the Warframe API provided by Digital Extremes for their game Warframe

All content in this repository is unofficial fan content, using data owned by Digital Extremes. All data displayed by the app is owned by Digital Extremes and the makers of this app support no claims of ownership over the data.

With that out of the way, welcome to the Tenno Sanctuary Project.

We are here as a fan made site that allows players to view in game data from a webapp. We strive to support as much as we can given the API provided to us by Digital Extremes, but unfortunately some information is lacking. If this happens, you will see a message about missing data from the API. We cannot fix this, please do not file issues regarding these messages.
